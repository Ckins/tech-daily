## fundamental of computer system
* thread safety - threads do not interfere each other, specifically on the data they are processing.
* async-signal - Async-Signal-Safe operations are guaranteed not to interfere with operations that are being interrupted.
* example, For example, suppose a program is in the middle of a call to printf(3S) and a signal occurs whose handler itself calls printf(). In this case, the output of the two printf() statements would be intertwined. To avoid this, the handler should not call printf() itself when printf() might be interrupted by a signal.
