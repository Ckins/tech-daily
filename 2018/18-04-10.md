## git checkout
I learnt how to use git to make a new branch and develop several version of my code. It is great!
```bash
git checkout -b oldstate 08fefsa
git checkout oldstate
git checkout master
git log --oneline
```

## malloc lab
use FIFO and explict linkedlist to pass the checkpoint

## linked list with a dummy node
* it is useful to make insertion and deletion easy
* because there will not be the situation that the list is empty

## modify points in a doubly linked list
* remember each insertion needs to modify 4 pointers
* each deletion (with dummy node) requires 2, and you don't need to check the  edge case.
