TL;DR
1. clarification
2. think out loud
3. talk before you write
4. test solution

### example question
Given an array of number and a target, write a program to judge whether there is a pair of two number in this array, whose summation is equal to the target number.

For example,
{1, 2, 4, 5} target = 8
{1, 2, 4, 4} target = 8

### clarification
* in memory or not
* integer or floating number
* whether I could use the same number for multiple times
* the type of return value

### think out loud
* give the simplest solution first
* illustrate what you think

### test solution
* work through successful or unsuccesful cases
* test edge cases
